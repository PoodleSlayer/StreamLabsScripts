# StreamLabs Chatbot Scripts

This repo contains a collection of scripts for use with the StreamLabs chatbot.

## Event Countdown

The Event Countdown script allows you to use a chat command for counting down the days to a specified date. Supports cooldowns and permission levels. Currently assumes the user language is English but I might make this more versatile in the future.

## Game Commands

This script is for allowing chat to provide inputs for your game via a sequence of DirectInput key presses (using scan codes). Supports cooldowns and permissions levels.
