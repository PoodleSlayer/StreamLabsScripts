# StreamLabs Chatbot Scripts

This repo contains a collection of scripts for use with the StreamLabs chatbot.

## Event Countdown

The Event Countdown script allows you to use a chat command for counting down the days to a specified date. Supports cooldowns and permission levels. Currently assumes the user language is English but I might make this more versatile in the future.
